ASN Statuses & Meanings
-----------------------

draft           While the user is in the process of creating the ASN
submitted       After completion, user can submit the ASN to the warehouse
confirmed       After the warehouse confirms that the ASN has been received and generates a reference number for the same (stored in asn_wm_ref)
ready_to_ship   When the ASN is packed and ready for the carrier to pickup
shipped         When the carrier picks up the ASN
received/qc_pending        When the shipment is received at the warehouse. The counting of items happens at this point and quantity_received is updated against each SKU. QC is done after this step
qc_completed    When the QC of the items received is done and good/bad inventory is bifurcated.
closed          When all disputes (if any) on the ASN are resolved
